I see data science as taking the chaos of data and showing it's beauty through analysis, modeling, visualization, and communication. Solving problems for me are opportunities for creativity. As a former math teacher, I love being able to communicate to others the discoveries of data through amazing visualizations. I am passionate about every aspect of being a data scientist. This site will be a digital story of my journey. I hope you enjoy coming with me on this exciting adventure into the world of data!
